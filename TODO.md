## üö® **Android App Corrections Needed**
The Android app currently has the wrong architecture and needs these fixes:

### **Issues to Fix:**
- ‚ùå **Remove QR Display** - Android shouldn't generate QR codes
- ‚ùå **Remove Receiver Screen** - Android shouldn't receive video streams  
- ‚ùå **Fix Home Screen** - Should only have "Scan QR" and "Settings" options
- ‚úÖ **Keep QR Scanner** - Android needs to scan Windows QR codes
- ‚úÖ **Keep Screen Capture** - Android needs to stream its screen to Windows

### **Correct Android Flow Should Be:**
```
Android: Home ‚Üí QR Scanner ‚Üí Screen Capture/Sender ‚Üí (Streams to Windows)
Windows: Home ‚Üí QR Display ‚Üí Receiver ‚Üí (Displays Android screen)
```

### **Android App Structure Should Be:**
- `home_screen.dart` - Main menu with "Scan QR Code" button
- `qr_scanner_screen.dart` - Scan Windows QR codes ‚úÖ
- `screen_capture_screen.dart` - Capture and stream Android screen ‚úÖ
- ~~`qr_display_screen.dart`~~ - ‚ùå Remove completely
- ~~`receiver_screen.dart`~~ - ‚ùå Remove completely
